I'm Marshal Zhang in Option1

The game that I created is called Monopoly.
You can buy houses, upgrade them, but you have to pay others if you have stepped onto other's area.

There two places that are randomly generated, one for lucky place, the other one for bad luck. If you go to this places, something will happen.

The first column shows the position, the second column shows where the players are at, the third column shows whose the house is, the forth column show the cost of the house.
