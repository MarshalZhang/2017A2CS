Spring festival improvements on <monopoly>

During the spring festival, I improve my program by making multiplayer possible. So, player(s) will be able to choose the number of player. And also, the player can choose the size of the map. Above all, the new features that I put into my program allow player to DIY a lots of things. 

I implemented the old way of changing players or positions, now everything is kept in linked list to ensure that everything goes on well. For example, when the direction of a player is reversed by the Lucky place or one of the player run out of money. Then everything will still work on perfectly.
