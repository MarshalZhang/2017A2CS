Pre-release Task 1

Task 1.1
Research the purpose of JSP structure diagrams.

Taks 1.2
Find out the meaning of the different symbols inside the boxes and how these affect the structure of the program.

Repetition is shown by an asterisk(*) in the corner of components that are repeated.
Selection is shown by a circle in the corner of components where only one is chosen.

These affect the structure of the program by adding loops(while) or boolean expressing(if).



Task 1.3
While 
    CALL ReadSalary()
    IF Salary>50:
        THEN
           IF Salary>90
              Then
                 Role-Project Manager
              Else
                 Role-Lead Developer
           ENDIF
        ELSE
           Role-Manager
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE

Task 1.4
A new role is introduced. Ay member of staff earring more than 70 and less than 90 is now called a Consultant.

Edit the JSP structure diagram to include theConsultant role.
Change the box that writes Salary>=90 to Salary>=70
if it is False, assign Lead Developer.
if it is True, include another boolean expression that write Salary>=90
if it is True, Assign Project Manager.
if it is False, Assign Consultant.

Task 1.5
Edit the pseudocode algorithm to add the Consultant role.
Look at task 1.4 and change the code accordingly.

Task 1.6
Write a function in program code to determine the role of a staff member.
The function will take salary as its parameter, and return the role.

Look at the python file Task 1.6.py

TASK 2
TASK 2.1
Toy: Name ID Price Minimum age           
ComputerGame: Category  Console         
Vehicle: Vehicle

Task 2.2
Find out what is meant by inheritance 
The computerGame and Vehicle classes inherit from the Toy class
Inheritance: all attributes and methods of the base class are copied to the subclass.
Two arrows from the Toy to ComputerGame and Vehicle.

Task 2.3
Write program code to create the Toy class. Make sure:
Look at the python file Task 2.3.py

Task 2.4
Write program code to create the computerGame and Vehicle classes. Make sure:
Look at the python file Task 2.3.py

Task 2.5
Add Validation to 

Task 2.6

Task 2.8
Look at the python file Task 2.3.py

Task 2.9
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
